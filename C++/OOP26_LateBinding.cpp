// Module: Virtual functions

// What is early binding (also called Static Binding or Compile-Time Binding) ?
// -> Early binding occurs at compile time. The compiler determines the appropriate function or
//    be called during the compilation phase. Early binding is default behavior of compiler.


// What is late binding (also called Dynamic Binding or Runtime Binding) ?
// -> Late binding occurs at runtime. The compiler determines which function to call dynamically
//    at runtime. Late binding allows the program to achieve runtime polymorphism. Late binding
//    is done through virtual functions.

    p->f2();   // I am f2 of Sportscar, calls f2() of SportsCar as the pointer 'p' contains address
    // an object of type SportsCar. This happens due to late binding. Late binding is done by
    // seeing content of pointer, i.e., type of object the pointer points to.

    // p->f3();   // compile-time error
    // f3() is early bind with p. So by seeing type of pointer, the compiler tries of find f3()
    // in Car class. And when there is no f3() found, the compiler throws an error.
